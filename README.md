## Start big and work your way down
We already have our Page up there, now let’s map out the Organisms using a red marker. We‘re skipping the Template since it’s basically the skeleton of the page without the pictures and the actual data, however, it is still an important step when designing or building a product.
Since we are working our way down, We can’t define Organisms using molecules as Brad Frost did. So we’ll come up with our own definition.

### Organisms
* Large sections that can easily be extracted from the page.

### Molecules
* Sections you can easily extract from an **ORGANISM**.

### Atoms
* The smallest part of an element that can exist they include HTML elements like: 
- Labels
- Inputs
- Buttons

## Step Process
1. Split the page design into large sections — Organisms
2. Next, divide your Organisms into Molecules, Look out for sections that are repeated frequently
3. Then, Extract your atoms from the Molecules. Remember elements that can’t be broken up any further

## For components to be reusable and composable, you have to make them as small and as independent as possible.

## Callbacks
*  A callback is a function that is to be executed after another function (normally asynchronous) has finished executing.
- In JavaScript, functions are objects. Because of this, functions can take functions as arguments, and can be returned by other functions. Functions that do this are called higher-order functions. Any function that is passed as an argument and subsequently called by the function that receives it, is called a callback function.
